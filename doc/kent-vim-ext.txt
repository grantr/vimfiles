==============================================================================

This help file gives an overview over the Kent Vim Extensions. The purpose of
these extensions is to make the use of Vim easier, especially for programming
tasks, while preserving the extraordinary features of Vim, which make it
(imho) one of the best editors available.

Note: These extensions are tested for Vim version 6.1 onwards. No guarantees
for lower versions!

Many of the ideas came from my supervisor, Peter Welch, for which I am very
grateful.

There are the following parts:

|kent-folding|		Extensions to improve the look and feel of folds.
			Especially the possibility to enter folds, inspired by
			the old origami editor, is very useful.
|kent-improve|		Improvements to the look and feel of Vim.
|kent-gui-improve|	Improvements to the look and feel of GVim. (These are
			only available in GUI mode!)
|kent-programming|	Extensions useful for programming tasks.
|kent-occam|		Extensions related to the occam language.

Also have a look at:
|occam|			The occam Checklist by Peter Welch.

Note: If you need help for a shortcut, please use the following order:
Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Key. Use dashes between the parts. For example: >

	<Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Insert>

The <> are optional.

Another way is to let Vim create the shortcut pattern for you. For example, if
you need help for <Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Insert>, type in command line ":help ", then
press <Ctrl-Q> and the shortcut you need help for. So the following appears
(in this case): >

	:help <M-C-S-Insert>

Now just press <Enter> to show the relevant help.

Have fun!
Mario
