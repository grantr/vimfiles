*kent-programming-commentsandfiletypes*
Comments and file types
=======================

For a number of commands and shortcuts of the Kent Vim Extensions, Vim needs to
know how text is commented for the current file type. For this there is a
function >

	function GetComment(lang, which)

in the >

	kent-programming.vim

script file which is part of the Kent Vim Extensions. Comments for some common
file types are already in there, but if you need others, feel free to add
them to the function. The function should be pretty self-explanatory, but if
you have questions or want to share an updated version of the function, feel
free to contact the maintainer.
