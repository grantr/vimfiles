==============================================================================

This help file gives an overview over the Kent Folding Extensions.

Please note that they will ONLY work properly with 'swapfile' switched on,
'foldmethod' set to marker and WITHOUT manually setting the foldlevel, i.e.
without things like }}}1

For all tasks there exists a command and for most of them there is a shortcut
too. Please note that in console mode some of the shortcuts might not work. In
this case please use the commands.

For a general introduction to folding see |folding|.

==============================================================================
*kent-folding-create*
Create folds
============

Commands
--------
			*:Foldcreate* *:FC*
:{range}Foldcreate	Create a fold by folding the lines in {range}. The
:{range}FC		cursor is then left at a position where a fold comment
			can be entered immediately. See also
			|kent-programming-commentsandfiletypes|.

Shortcuts
---------
			*Alt-Insert* *<Alt-Insert>* *<M-Insert>*
			*Alt-Up* *<Alt-Up>* *<M-Up>*
			*Alt-Down* *<Alt-Down>* *<M-Down>*
<Alt-Insert>		Pressing <Alt-Insert> the first time selects the
			current line. Then you can extend the selection with
			<Alt-Up> or <Alt-Down>. Pressing <Alt-Insert> again
			then creates a fold by folding the selected lines. The
			cursor is then left at a position where a fold comment
			can be entered immediately. See also
			|kent-programming-commentsandfiletypes|.

			Note: In origami:Alt mode (see |kent-origamimode|),
			pressing <Insert> behaves like <Alt-Insert>.

==============================================================================
*kent-folding-recover*
Recover folds after a crashed session
=====================================

Vim maintains swap files so that after a crashed session a file can be
recovered. If you are not inside a fold when a Vim session crashes, just use
the normal Vim recovery mechanism described in |usr_11.txt|. If you are inside
a fold when a Vim session crashes, use the following methodology:

* Re-open the file. Vim will ask you whether you want to recover the file.
  Choose the recovery option, and the file will be recovered. Now the file only
  contains the fold you were inside when the last Vim session crashed.
* Check whether the content of this fold is OK. If yes, save the file and
  close Vim.
* Re-open the file again. Vim will ask you again whether you want to recover
  the file. Now choose to delete the swap file.
* Then Vim will tell you that a fold information swap file for this file
  already exists and will ask you whether to start the recovery. Choose the
  recovery option.
* The remaining areas of the file (outside the fold) are now being recovered.
  Check whether the file is OK now. If yes, save the file. You can now
  continue editing the file.
* Vim will not delete the folding swap files unless you either explicitly tell
  Vim to do so or you enter a fold after the recovery has finished. Should you
  open the file later, and Vim again asks you about recovery, you can then
  choose to delete the folding swap files.

You can either use the automatic detection of previous swap files as described
above, or you can do the recovery manually using the |:Foldrecover| command.

Commands
--------
			*:Foldrecover* *:FR*
:Foldrecover [infofile]	Calling this command will cause Vim to look for a fold
:FR [infofile]		information swap file. It will either use the
			(optional) [infofile] argument if it is provided with
			the command, otherwise it will use the name of the
			current swap file plus ".fold.info". (Please note that
			fold information swap files always end with
			".fold.info".) Vim will then ask you whether to
			recover the previous session using this fold
			information swap file or to delete it (or to cancel
			the operation).

==============================================================================
*kent-folding-shortcuts*
Table of the "sixpack" shortcuts 
================================

Most of the shortcuts concerning folding are mapped to one of the "sixpack"
keys <Insert>, <Del>, <Home>, <End>, <PageUp> and <PageDown> in combination
with <Ctrl>, <Shift> and <Alt>.

The following table gives an overview over the mappings:

M = Alt
C = Ctrl
S = Shift

+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

| |<M-C-S-Insert>|       | |<M-C-S-Home>|         | |<M-C-S-PageUp>|       |
|    Eliminate folds     |    Disable folding     |    Enable folding      |
+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

|    Delete folds        |    Open folds          |    Close folds         |
|                        | |<M-C-End>|            | |<M-C-PageDown>|       |
|                        |    Open all folds      |    Close all folds     |
| |<M-S-Del>|            | |<M-S-End>|            | |<M-S-PageDown>|       |

|                        |    Increase fold level |    Decrease fold level |
+------------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

Note: In origami mode (see |kent-origamimode|), pressing one of the "sixpack"
keys behaves like pressing it together with <Alt>, <Ctrl-Alt>, <Shift-Alt>,
or <Ctrl-Shift-Alt>.
